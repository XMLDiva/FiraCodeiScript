#The New Fira Code iScript

Fira Code iScript is a font hybrid with ligatures as well as a nice cursive style font for italics, allowing a distinct visual difference for keywords and comments (with appropriate style theme applied).

The regular and bold fonts (and where the ligatures are from) are from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode); the italic is from [Script12](https://www.myfontsfree.com/134618/script12pitchbt.htm).

I have waaay too much time on my hands and I love to do something new. So I've taken the original Fira Code & Fira Code iScript and adjusted it to my liking. After using it for awhile, I actually decided I found it difficult to read at smaller fonts. So I created a font Fira Code mScript as well. To each their own.

## Updated from Original

Here's what's changed from the origianl Fira Code iScript.

### Italic

The meta data has been tweeked so that more applications recognize the italic font (it previously wasn't marked as italic).

### Spacing

The font is now correctly monospaced and is a matching width to Fira Code

### New Characters

I'm really picky so I didn't like the following characters.
